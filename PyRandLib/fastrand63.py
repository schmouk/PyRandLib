class FastRand63( BaseLCG ):
    """
    Pseudo-random numbers generator - Linear Congruential Generator dedicated  
    to  63-bits calculations with very short period (about 9.2e+18) and short
    time computation.
    This module is part of library PyRandLib.
    
    Copyright (c) 2016-2021 Philippe Schmouker

    LCG models evaluate pseudo-random numbers suites x(i) as a simple mathem-
    atical function of 
    
        x(i-1): x(i) = (a*x(i-1) + c) mod m 
     
    Results  are  nevertheless  considered  to  be  poor  as  stated  in  the 
    evaluation done by Pierre L'Ecuyer and Richard Simard (Universite de 
    Montreal) in 'TestU01: A C Library for Empirical Testing of Random Number 
    Generators  -  ACM  Transactions  on  Mathematical Software,  vol.33  n.4,  
    pp.22-40,  August  2007'.  It is not recommended to use such pseudo-random 
    numbers generators for serious simulation applications.
   
    The implementation of this LCG 63-bits model is based on (a=9219741426499971445, c=1)
    since  these  two  values  have  evaluated  to be the 'best' ones for LCGs 
    within TestU01 while m = 2^63.

    See FastRand32 for a 2^32 (i.e. 4.3e+9) period LC-Generator with very  low 
    computation  time  but shorter period and worse randomness characteristics
    than for FastRand63.
      
    Furthermore this class is callable:
      rand = FastRand63()
      print( rand() )    # prints a uniform pseudo-random value within [0.0, 1.0)
      print( rand(a) )   # prints a uniform pseudo-random value within [0.0, a)
      print( rand(a,b) ) # prints a uniform pseudo-random value within [a  , b)

    Notice that for simulating the roll of a dice you should program:
      diceRoll = FastRand63()
      print( int(diceRoll(1, 7)) ) # prints a uniform roll within set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

    Such a programming is an accelerated while still robust emulation of  the 
    inherited methods:
      - random.Random.randint(self,1,6) and 
      - random.Random.randrange(self,1,7,1)

    Reminder:
    We give you here below a copy of the table of tests for the LCGs that have 
    been implemented in PyRandLib, as provided in paper "TestU01, ..."  -  see
    file README.md.

    * _small crush_ is a small set of simple tests that quickly tests some  of
    the expected characteristics for a pretty good PRG;
    * _crush_ is a bigger set of tests that test more deeply  expected  random 
    characteristics
    * _big crush_ is the ultimate set of difficult tests  that  any  GOOD  PRG 
    should definitively pass.
