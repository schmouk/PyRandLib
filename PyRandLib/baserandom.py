    See MRGRand287 for a short period  MR-Generator (2^287,  i.e. 2.49e+86)  with  low
    computation time but 256 integers memory consumption.

    longer  computation  time  (2^31-1  modulus  calculations)  but  less memory space 
    consumption (47 integers).
    See MRGRand49507 for a far  longer  period  (2^49507,  i.e. 1.2e+14903)  with  low 
    computation  time  too  (31-bits  modulus)  but  use  of  more  memory space (1597

    generators  (resp.  2^78,  2^116,  2^668  and 2^1340 periods,  i.e. resp. 3.0e+23,

    Python built-in class random.Random is subclassed here to use  a  different  basic 
    generator of our own devising: in that case, overriden methods are:
    
      random(), seed(), getstate(), and setstate().
    
    Furthermore this class and all its inheriting sub-classes are callable. Example:
      rand = BaseRandom()
      print( rand() )    # prints a uniform pseudo-random value within [0.0, 1.0)
      print( rand(a) )   # prints a uniform pseudo-random value within [0.0, a)
      print( rand(a,b) ) # prints a uniform pseudo-random value within [a  , b)
    
    Please notice that for simulating the roll of a dice you should program:
      diceRoll = UFastRandom()
      print( int( diceRoll(1, 7) ) ) # prints a uniform roll within {1, ..., 6}.
    Such a programming is a simplified  while  still  robust  emulation  of  inherited
    methods random.Random.randint(self,1,6) and random.Random.randrange(self,1,7,1).
 
    Inheriting random.Random, next methods are available:
     |
     |  betavariate(self, alpha, beta)
     |      Beta distribution.
     |      
     |      Conditions on the parameters are alpha > 0 and beta > 0.
     |      Returned values range between 0 and 1.
     |  
     |
     |  choice(self, seq)
     |      Choose a random element from a non-empty sequence.
     |  
     |
     |  expovariate(self, lambd)
     |      Exponential distribution.
     |      
     |      lambd is 1.0 divided by the desired mean.  It should be
     |      nonzero.  (The parameter would be called "lambda", but that is
     |      a reserved word in Python.)  Returned values range from 0 to
     |      positive infinity if lambd is positive, and from negative
     |      infinity to 0 if lambd is negative.
     |  
     |
     |  gammavariate(self, alpha, beta)
     |      Gamma distribution.  Not the gamma function!
     |      
     |      Conditions on the parameters are alpha > 0 and beta > 0.
     |  
     |
     |  gauss(self, mu, sigma)
     |      Gaussian distribution.
     |      
     |      mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation.  This is
     |      slightly faster than the normalvariate() function.
     |      
     |      Not thread-safe without a lock around calls.
     |  
     |
     |  getstate(self)
     |      Return internal state; can be passed to setstate() later.
     |  
     |
     |  lognormvariate(self, mu, sigma)
     |      Log normal distribution.
     |      
     |      If you take the natural logarithm of this distribution, you'll get a
     |      normal distribution with mean mu and standard deviation sigma.
     |      mu can have any value, and sigma must be greater than zero.
     |  
     |
     |  normalvariate(self, mu, sigma)
     |      Normal distribution.
     |      
     |      mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation.
     |  
     |
     |  paretovariate(self, alpha)
     |      Pareto distribution.  alpha is the shape parameter.
     |  
     |
     |  randint(self, a, b)
     |      Return random integer in range [a, b], including both end points.
     |  
     |
     |  randrange(self, start, stop=None, step=1, int=<class 'int'>)
     |      Choose a random item from range(start, stop[, step]).
     |      
     |      This fixes the problem with randint() which includes the
     |      endpoint; in Python this is usually not what you want.
     |      
     |      Do not supply the 'int' argument.
     |  
     |
     |  sample(self, population, k)
     |      Chooses k unique random elements from a population sequence or set.
     |      
     |      Returns a new list containing elements from the population while
     |      leaving the original population unchanged.  The resulting list is
     |      in selection order so that all sub-slices will also be valid random
     |      samples.  This allows raffle winners (the sample) to be partitioned
     |      into grand prize and second place winners (the subslices).
     |      
     |      Members of the population need not be hashable or unique.  If the
     |      population contains repeats, then each occurrence is a possible
     |      selection in the sample.
     |      
     |      To choose a sample in a range of integers, use range as an argument.
     |      This is especially fast and space efficient for sampling from a
     |      large population:   sample(range(10000000), 60)
     |  
     |
     |  seed(self, a=None, version=2)
     |      Initialize internal state from hashable object.
     |      
     |      None or no argument seeds from current time or from an operating
     |      system specific randomness source if available.
     |      
     |      For version 2 (the default), all of the bits are used if *a *is a str,
     |      bytes, or bytearray.  For version 1, the hash() of *a* is used instead.
     |      
     |      If *a* is an int, all bits are used.
     |  
     |
     |  setstate(self, state)
     |      Restore internal state from object returned by getstate().
     |  
     |
     |  shuffle(self, x, random=None, int=<class 'int'>)
     |      x, random=random.random -> shuffle list x in place; return None.
     |      
     |      Optional arg random is a 0-argument function returning a random
     |      float in [0.0, 1.0); by default, the standard random.random.
     |  
     |
     |  triangular(self, low=0.0, high=1.0, mode=None)
     |      Triangular distribution.
     |      
     |      Continuous distribution bounded by given lower and upper limits,
     |      and having a given mode value in-between.
     |      
     |      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_distribution
     |  
     |
     |  uniform(self, a, b)
     |      Get a random number in the range [a, b) or [a, b] depending on rounding.
     |  
     |
     |  vonmisesvariate(self, mu, kappa)
     |      Circular data distribution.
     |      
     |      mu is the mean angle, expressed in radians between 0 and 2*pi, and
     |      kappa is the concentration parameter, which must be greater than or
     |      equal to zero.  If kappa is equal to zero, this distribution reduces
     |      to a uniform random angle over the range 0 to 2*pi.
     |  
     |
     |  weibullvariate(self, alpha, beta)
     |      Weibull distribution.
     |      
     |      alpha is the scale parameter and beta is the shape parameter.
