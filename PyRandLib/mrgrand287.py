    """
    Pseudo-random numbers generator  - Definition of a fast 32-bits Multiple Recursive
    Generator with a long period (2.49e+86).
    This module is part of library PyRandLib.
    
    Copyright (c) 2016-2021 Philippe Schmouker

    Multiple Recursive Generators (MRGs)  use  recurrence  to  evaluate  pseudo-random
    numbers suites. Recurrence is of the form:
    
       x(i) = A * SUM[ x(i-k) ]  mod M
    
    for 2 to more k different values.

    MRGs offer very large periods with the best known results  in  the  evaluation  of 
    their  randomness,  as  stated  in  the  evaluation  done  by  Pierre L'Ecuyer and 
    Richard Simard (Universite de Montreal)  in "TestU01:  A C Library  for  Empirical 
    Testing of Random  Number Generators  - ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, 
    vol.33 n.4, pp.22-40, August 2007".  It is recommended to use  such  pseudo-random
    numbers generators rather than LCG ones for serious simulation applications.

    The implementation of this MRG 32-bits  model  is  based  on  a  Lagged  Fibonacci 
    generator (LFIB), the Marsa-LFIB4 one.
    Lagged Fibonacci generators LFib( m, r, k, op) use the recurrence
    
        x(i) = (x(i-r) op (x(i-k)) mod m
    
    where op is an operation that can be
        + (addition),
        - (substraction),
        * (multiplication),
        ^(bitwise exclusive-or).
    
    With the + or - operation, such generators are in fact MRGs. They offer very large
    periods  with  the  best  known  results in the evaluation of their randomness, as
    stated in the evaluation done by Pierre L'Ecuyer and Richard Simard (Universite de
    Montreal) paper.
    
    The Marsa-LIBF4 version uses the recurrence
    
        x(i) = (x(i-55) + x(i-119) + x(i-179) + x(i-256)) mod 2^32
    
    and offers a period of about 2^287 - i.e. 2.49e+86 - with low computation time due
    to the use of a 2^32 modulo.
    
    See MRGRand1457 for a  longer  period  MR-Generator  (2^1457,  i.e. 4.0e+438)  and 
    longer  computation  time  (2^31-1  modulus  calculations)  but  less memory space 
    consumption (47 integers).
    See MRGRand49507 for a far longer period  (2^49_507,  i.e. 1.2e+14_903)  with  low 
    computation  time  too  (31-bits  modulus)  but  use  of  more memory space (1_597 
    integers).
      
    Furthermore this class is callable:
      rand = MRGRand287()
      print( rand() )    # prints a uniform pseudo-random value within [0.0, 1.0)
      print( rand(a) )   # prints a uniform pseudo-random value within [0.0, a)
      print( rand(a,b) ) # prints a uniform pseudo-random value within [a  , b)

    Notice that for simulating the roll of a dice you should program:
      diceRoll = MRGRand287()
      print( int(diceRoll(1, 7)) ) # prints a uniform roll within set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

    Such a programming is an accelerated while still robust emulation of  the 
    inherited methods:
      - random.Random.randint(self,1,6) and 
      - random.Random.randrange(self,1,7,1)

    Reminder:
    We give you here below a copy of the table of tests for the LCGs that have 
    been implemented in PyRandLib, as provided in paper "TestU01, ..."  -  see
    file README.md.

    * _small crush_ is a small set of simple tests that quickly tests some  of
    the expected characteristics for a pretty good PRG;
    * _crush_ is a bigger set of tests that test more deeply  expected  random 
    characteristics;
    * _big crush_ is the ultimate set of difficult tests  that  any  GOOD  PRG 
    should definitively pass.
