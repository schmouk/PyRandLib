class BaseLFib64( BaseRandom ):
    """The base class for all LFib PRG based on 64-bits numbers.
    
    Definition of the base class for all LFib pseudo-random generators based
    on 64-bits generated numbers.
    This module is part of library PyRandLib.
    
    Copyright (c) 2016-2021 Philippe Schmouker

    Lagged Fibonacci generators LFib( m, r, k, op) use the recurrence
    
        x(i) = (x(i-r) op (x(i-k)) mod m
    
    where op is an operation that can be:
        + (addition),
        - (substraction),
        * (multiplication),
        ^(bitwise exclusive-or).
    
    With the + or - operation, such generators are in fact MRGs. They offer very large
    periods  with  the  best  known  results in the evaluation of their randomness, as
    stated in the evaluation done by Pierre L'Ecuyer and Richard Simard (Universite de
    Montreal)  in  "TestU01:  A  C  Library  for Empirical Testing  of  Random  Number  
    Generators - ACM Transactions  on  Mathematical  Software,  vol.33 n.4,  pp.22-40, 
    August 2007".  It  is  recommended  to  use  such pseudo-random numbers generators 
    rather than LCG ones for serious simulation applications.
       
    See LFib78,  LFib116,  LFib668 and LFib1340 for long period LFib generators (resp. 
    2^78,  2^116,  2^668 and 2^1340 periods, i.e. resp. 3.0e+23, 8.3e+34, 1.2e+201 and 
    2.4e+403 periods) while same computation time and far  higher  precision  (64-bits  
    calculations) than MRGs,  but more memory consumption (resp. 17,  55, 607 and 1279 
    integers).
    
    Please notice that this class and all its  inheriting  sub-classes  are  callable.
    Example:
    
      rand = BaseLFib()
      print( rand() )    # prints a uniform pseudo-random value within [0.0, 1.0)
      print( rand(a) )   # prints a uniform pseudo-random value within [0.0, a)
      print( rand(a,b) ) # prints a uniform pseudo-random value within [a  , b)
    
    Inheriting classes have to define class attribute '_LIST_SIZE'.  See LFib78 for an
    example.

    Reminder:
    We give you here below a copy of the table of tests for the LCGs that have 
    been implemented in PyRandLib, as provided in paper "TestU01, ..."  -  see
    file README.md.

    * _small crush_ is a small set of simple tests that quickly tests some  of
    the expected characteristics for a pretty good PRG;
    * _crush_ is a bigger set of tests that test more deeply  expected  random 
    characteristics;
    * _big crush_ is the ultimate set of difficult tests  that  any  GOOD  PRG 
    should definitively pass.
